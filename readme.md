## Music CDs Frontend App  

- A front-end application where users can add music CDs to a table and delete them.  
- There are **two versions** of the list:  
  1. **Temporary List** – The list is stored in memory and disappears when the browser is refreshed.  
  2. **Persistent List** – The list is saved in **local storage**, so it remains even after refreshing the browser.  
- Users can remove CDs in both versions, but in the persistent list, they are permanently deleted from local storage.
